<!--requirement 2-->
    <h2 style="color: midnightblue;">Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Nick and I am a junior here at Lewis University.
        My degree is in computer science wih a concentration in game and simulation programming.
        I also plan on getting my masters degree with a concentration in AI.
        I am a triplet (two sisters and me), and I also have a younger sister.
        In my free time I enjoy playing and collecting video games.
        My favorite console is probably the Nintendo Entertainment System (nes),
         because it was the first retro game console I bought, and I also happen to share my initials with it.

    <h2 style="color: purple;">My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>My favorite hobby is video game collecting. I start playing video games when I was 4 years old and my parents bought 
        my sisters and I the Nintendo Gamecube. To this day 17 years later we still all play it and have all of our original games
        and controllers for it. A few years later in 2007 we got a Nintendo Wii, which we sadly do not have anymore cause it broke a while ago.
        Once our Wii broke, our parents got us the WiiU for christmas in 2016. It is easily my least played console and I only have 2 games for 
        it (Minecraft and Zelda: Breath of the Wild) but it is still very fun. That was also the last game console our parents got all of us. 
        Somewhere along the way I bought myself a Nintendo 64, however I have no clue when that was. I also bought a Playstation 2 but I ended up giving 
        it to my sisters, for $10. In 2015 I bought myself the Nintendo Entertainment System. A year later I bought myself an Xbox One. Then on January 8th of 2019 I bought 
        myself the Nintendo Switch using money I got from working overtime and on holidays at a movie theater I used to work at. In the summer of 2019 
        I built my own pc for the first time, but I had some experience from a high school class I took on computers. The last console 
        I got in 2019 was a destiny edition of the ps4 around christmas time. Then there was 2020.

    <p>
        2020 was the single biggest year for an increase in my collection, which is pretty ironic because
        of how everything was shut down for half the year, so I guess you could say it was my biggest ever  
        increase even in only the last 9 months of 2020. In April I got a Playstation 1. In May I got myself a 
        Super Nintendo Entertainment System and a Sega Genesis. At the end of May I got a Sega Dreamcast and an Original Xbox. 
        At the end of 2020 I got a Playstation 2 of my own for christmas. 2021 just started and I ended up buying my most recent
        console in my collection, which is also ironically the oldest console I own, the Mattel Intellivision.
